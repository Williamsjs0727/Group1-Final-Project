    "# NYC Apartment Search - Group 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of the Project:\n",
    "The project uses data-driven approaches to analyze and visualize New York City apartment data, 311 complaints, and urban forestry data to help understand urban living dynamics. This analysis is intended to aid in making informed decisions about apartment rentals based on environmental and urban living conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sections and Key Functions:\n",
    "1. **Setup**\n",
    "   - Initializes the environment with necessary libraries and settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Part 1: Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - Functions to load and clean data from various sources (ZIP codes, 311 complaints, tree census, Zillow rent data).\n",
    "   - Quality checks and basic data explorations are conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Part 2: Storing Data**\n",
    "   - Database setup functions to create tables and indices.\n",
    "   - Functions to convert geometries for database insertion and to insert cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "   - Data retrieval functions to fetch and display samples from each database table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Part 3: Understanding the Data**\n",
    "   - Functions to execute SQL queries and to extract meaningful insights from the database.\n",
    "   - Various SQL queries analyze the relationship between apartment prices, complaints, and tree census data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Part 4: Visualizing the Data**\n",
    "   - Multiple visualizations to represent data insights graphically, including trends over time and spatial distributions."

    "1. **Defining and Applying the Database Schema `(define_and_apply_schema())`**:\n",
    "   - Created four tables: zipcode_data, complaints_data, tree_data, and zillow_data\n",

    "   - Wrote the defined schema to an SQL file and executed it to apply the schema to the database\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Converting Geometries for Database Insertion `(convert_geom())`**:\n",
    "   - Converted the geometry data in the GeoDataFrame to Well-Known Text (WKT) format for storage in the database\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inserting Data into the Database `(insert_data())`**:\n",
    "   - Used the pandas `to_sql()` method to insert the cleaned datasets into the corresponding database tables\n",
    "   - Specified the data types, ensuring the geometry data is stored correctly\n",
    "   - Handled any exceptions that may occur during the data insertion process\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fetching Data from the Database `(fetch_data())`**:\n",
    "   - Defined a generic function to use pandas' `read_sql_query()` to retrieve data from the database based on a provided SQL query\n",
    "   - Provided an example usage, querying the row counts for each of the tables and returning the results\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this part of the code completed the process of storing the cleaned data in a PostgreSQL database, and provided related read and write interfaces, laying the foundation for further data analysis and exploration."
